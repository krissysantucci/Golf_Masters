Goal: 
   Create an optimized machine learning model that can predict a Golfer’s score and/or probability of placing in the top 10 at a future PGA Masters Tournament.
Data: Source: 
  Kaggle (PGATour.com web scrape)
  Statistics of all players on the PGA Tour from 2010 to 2018 seasons – summarized by year.
  Statistics can be divided into the following categories:
     Off The Tee
     Approach The Green
     Around The Green
     Putting
Used "Strokes Gained" to compare the performance to the rest of the field and isolate individual aspects of the game: Off-the-Tee, Approach-the-Green, Around-the-Green, Putting

Performed a cluster analysis to determine in which groups the highest concentration of winners fell in the 4 categories.
